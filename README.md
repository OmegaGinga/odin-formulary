Hello! This time i will make a formulary for The Odin Project.

Now it will consist in 3 main sections:
1.- The first section will have a background image and a logo with a background color
2.- The second section will have a message about the formulary
3.-This last section have 2 parts but all involve the creation of the formulary where the customer will enter they data.
